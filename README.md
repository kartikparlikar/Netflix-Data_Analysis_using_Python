# Netflix-Data_Analysis_using_Python

Netflix is one of the most popular streaming services in the world, providing users with access to a vast collection of TV shows and movies. The platform has gained a massive following in recent years, and its popularity shows no signs of slowing down. In this blog, we’ll be using Python to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Netflix dataset that we’ve found on Kaggle. We’ll be using various Python libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, to visualize and analyze the data.
